# LabdooApp_v0.1
Prototyp LabdooApp

This is a prototype for the Labdoo App. 
Labdoo is a humanitarian network. Learn more here: http://labdoo.org/

This repository provides a Xamarin.Forms app and has been tested on Android (4.4 to 6.0) and Windows 10.
The app has a personalized start screen for doner/traveller, a dootrip creation form, dootrips and dootronics pages. The Edoovillages, dootrips and dootronics are used from a rest service of a labdoo installation (rest urls have been changed). 
It also has a news page where tweets from https://twitter.com/TestNewsLabdoo are embeded. The necessery keys have also been deleted for github.
